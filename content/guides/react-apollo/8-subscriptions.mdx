This section is all about bringing realtime functionality into the app by using
GraphQL subscriptions.

### What are GraphQL Subscriptions?

Subscriptions are a GraphQL feature allowing the server to send data to its
clients when a specific _event_ happens. Subscriptions are usually implemented
with [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), where the server
holds a steady connection to the client. This means when working with subscriptions,
you're breaking the _Request-Response-Cycle_ that was used for all previous interactions
with the API. The client now initiates a steady connection with the server by specifying
which event it is interested in. Every time this particular event then happens, the server
uses the connection to push the expected data to the client.

### Subscriptions with Apollo

When using Apollo, you need to configure your `ApolloClient` with information about
the subscriptions endpoint. This is done by adding another `ApolloLink` to the Apollo
middleware chain. This time, it's the `WebSocketLink` from the
[`apollo-link-ws`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages/apollo-link-ws)
package.

Go and add this dependency to your app first.
