The last topic that we'll cover in this tutorial is pagination. You'll implement
a simple pagination approach so that users are able to view the links in smaller
chunks rather than having an extremely long list of `Link` elements.

## Preparing the React Components

Once more, you first need to prepare the React components for this new functionality.
In fact, we'll slightly adjust the current routing setup. Here's the idea:
The `LinkList` component will be used for two different use cases (and routes).
The first one is to display the 10 top voted links. Its second use case is to
display new links in a list separated into multiple pages that the user can
navigate through.s
