### Install Dependencies

It's time to start creating your project. The First you'll need to have Elixir and
Erlang installed on your machine. See https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

Unlike some frameworks, Phoenix works within the ordinary structure of a regular
Elixir application. It does however bring its own generator to add in some basic
Phoenix code to get you going.

Install this generator:

```bash
mix local.hex --force && \
mix local.rebar --force && \
mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phx_new.ez
```

This tutorial also uses Postgres as the database for this app. See here for
installing postgres on your OS: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides

For OS X users it should be as simple as `brew install postgres`.

### Setting up your App

You're going to build an app called Community, and you can think of it as a
miniature version of Hacker News, Slashdot, or any other site that displays
content on the basis of user submissions and votes.

Use the `phx.new` generator (confirm with `y` when prompted):

```bash
mix phx.new community --no-brunch --no-html
```

Say `y` to the question about fetching and installing dependencies, and then cd
into the application directory.

In order to support GraphQL your application needs some additional dependencies
which are configured in the `mix.exs` file. They go inside the list found within
the `defp deps do` function:

```elixir
{:absinthe_ecto, "~> 0.1.0"},
{:absinthe_plug, "~> 1.3.0"},
```

Then run

```bash
mix deps.get
```

You're also going to generate some of the database tables and seed data now
so that you're all set for the rest of the tutorial.

```bash
mix phx.gen.context News Link links url:string description:text
```

Add the following lines to `priv/repo/seeds.exs` so that you have some
basic seed data:

```elixir
alias Community.News.Link
alias Community.Repo

%Link{url: "https://graphql.org/", description: "The Best Query Language"} |> Repo.insert!
%Link{url: "https://dev.apollodata.com/", description: "Awesome GraphQL Client"} |> Repo.insert!
```

Now just run

```bash
mix ecto.setup
```

At this point the database tables created, and the migrations and the have been run.
If at any point you want to clear everything out you can just run `mix ecto.reset`.
If you get postgres connection issues be sure to double check your database credentials
inside `config/dev.exs`.
